Installation instructions

Compilation from tarball
========================

Compilation requires a working C++ compiler, and the Xapian library (and
development headers) to be installed.  It does not depend on any of the Xapian
bindings for other programming languages.

Development has been performed in a Linux environment.  It has not yet been
tested in other environments.

FIXME: list requirements properly.

Compilation from checkout
=========================

To compile from a checkout, you will need to have the following additional
packages installed:

 - automake (version 1.10.2 or later)
 - autoconf (version 2.64 or later)
 - libtool (version 2.2.8 or later)

The "bootstrap" script will call these tools appropriately.
