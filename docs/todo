TODO
====

When processing documents, we need to be able to update the schema used for all subsequent processing.  Therefore, need to add a schema "cache" which holds the latest version of the schema as sent to the indexing queue, but not necessarily yet written to the indexer.  This cache, or the schema (or CollectionConfig derived from it) should be what is passed to processing jobs, instead of the Collection.

Before an initial release
-------------------------

 - Documentation.

 - Update libs/README

 - Sort out mess of types.  [Mostly done now]

 - Fix inconsistent namespacing used in code (RestPose is used in some places, but not others, for no particular reason).

 - Document -> JSON formatting should have two flavours: a "raw" mode, which doesn't unpack the document data, and a higher level mode which unpacks the document data, and also splits terms into prefix and value stored.

 - Rename "prefix" to something less implementation-specific?  "group"?  Define group shortnames somewhere special?
 - Complain if undefined groups are used?

 - Position data for multiple text fields should not overlap - and there should be a setting to define the spacing.
