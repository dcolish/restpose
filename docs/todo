Before an initial release
-------------------------

 - Documentation.

 - Update libs/README

 - Sort out mess of types.

 - Document -> JSON formatting should have two flavours: a "raw" mode, which doesn't unpack the document data, and a higher level mode which unpacks the document data, and also splits terms into prefix and value stored.

 - Rename "prefix" to something less implementation-specific?  "group"?  Define group shortnames somewhere special?
 - Complain if undefined groups are used?

 - Position data for multiple text fields should not overlap - and there should be a setting to define the spacing.
