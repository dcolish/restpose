Style notes
===========

Generally, we try and follow the same coding style as Xapian's core code.  Some
exceptions:

 - Header include ordering.  In header files, all headers should be included in
   lexicographical order.  If there is a good reason not to do this, a comment
   should explain it.  In source files, the <config.h> header should be
   included first, followed by any header directly describing a public
   interface for symbols defined in the source file.  All following headers
   should be in lexicographical order.  There should usually be a single blank
   line between the inital two headers and the following headers.
